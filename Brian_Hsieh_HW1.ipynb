    "### Question 1\n",
    "Recall that summation (or sigma notation) is a way of expressing a long sum in a concise way.  Let $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be collections of real numbers.  When you see $x_i$, you can think of the $i$ as an index for the $i^{th}$ $x$.  For example $x_2$ is the second $x$ value in the list $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.  We define sigma notation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_i = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ... + a_n x_n $$\n",
    "\t\n",
    "We commonly use sigma notation to compactly write the definition of the arithmetic mean (commonly known as the ``average``):\n",
    "\t\n",
    "$$ \\bar{x} = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\left(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the formula for population variance below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the functions below to compute the population variance of `population`, an array of numbers. For this question, do not use built in NumPy functions; we will use NumPy to verify your code."
